                    ABOUT ME </p>
                <p class="aboutme_text">My name is Karina Alakova, and I am a student of LCC International University
                    (Klaipeda, Lithuania).
                    I moved to this beautiful Baltic state at the age of 17, as soon as I finished high school. Since I
                    have never been to European cities before coming to Klaipeda, I was impressed by its old town and
                    gothic style of architecture.
                    Since then, each new European city became a discovery for me and it took me deeper into the place
                    branding topic, so my thesis was related to the Place Branding as well.</br>

        Branding
