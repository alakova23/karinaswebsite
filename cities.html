                    <bold>Prague.</bold> In the previous few years, Prague has established itself as one of the most
                    touristic and visited cities in the World. Moreover, this is happening not only because the
                    architecture of Prague is one of the most unique in Europe, but also because the Place Branding
                    program of is detailed and tactical, which helps the city develop and prosper. For example, a large
                    number of international students give Prague the status of an international city, which for
                    businessmen is one of the key qualities in choosing a place for investment.

                    <bold>Warsaw </bold>- Warsaw is a city of constant change. Itâ€™s not just its historic buildings,
                    location, or importance in the region, this is a city that wants to grow and move forward and this
                    is noticeable by the level of internationality, numerous investments, diversification and the
                    decision of large corporations such as Google or Microsoft to open their offices in this city. I
                    think by studying the place branding of Warsaw, it is possible to learn unique tactics and at the
                    same time see a win-win plan for building a city brand
                    </br>
                    <bold>Lisbon </bold>- Lisbon is a city that is more colorful and warm in contrast to Prague and
                    Warsaw, but it is not inferior in terms of place branding. According to the analysis of the previous
                    year, Lisbon has grown significantly in terms of investment and tourists. The city administration is
                    making every effort to preserve the uniqueness of the city, which is noticeable in the blocks and
                    streets that retain their appearance for many years
